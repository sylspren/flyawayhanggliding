# Fly Away Hang Gliding

Help a friend with a look and feel update to his hang gliding instruction website. No big changes requested,
site just looks a little 90s with image map links (for realz) and odd looking layout/font/colors. This project
goes for a minimal and quick update to the view only without a bit overhaul.

Existing app runs on a php server on a box maintained by someone else.
 1. avoid updating the tech stack to avoid maintaining this box forevermore
 1. for sanity and personal productivity spin up a node server with stylus to iterate until demo looks good
 1. finally port the generated html and css back into structure of original php server
 1. spin up a heroku php for final demo before deploy
