      <p>Welcome to Fly Away Hang Gliding. We've been providing hang gliding instruction and tandems to help people realize their dreams of free flight since 1995.  We are located in beautiful Santa Barbara, California.</p>

      <p>Learn to fly hang gliders on our 200 foot high training hill. It is one of the easiest-to-learn-on training hills in the world.  It's warm and 
      sunny here in Santa Barbara year round, and we have fresh, clean, smog-free air.  The weather is great for hang gliding lessons year round.</p>

      <p>Hang gliding is the closest humans can get to the feeling of flying like a bird, like in your dreams.</p>

      <p>You can soar with the birds. Hang gliding is the ultimate high.</p>

      <p>Directions to Elings Park.<br>
        Google <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=2650+Cliff+Drive,+Santa+Barbara,+CA&sll=34.405325,-119.736321&sspn=0.006117,0.004903&gl=us&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=2650+Cliff+Dr,+Santa+Barbara,+California+93101&ll=34.405024,-119.737383&spn=0.006117,0.008991&z=17">2650 Cliff Dr., Santa Barbara</a>. There is no address there, but it will put you very close to the entrance.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are traveling north on Hyw. 101 from Los Angeles, you will go left on Las Positas, towards the ocean. If you are traveling south from San Fransisco, go right on Las Positas.
        <br>
        <br>
        Go about 1 mile, through several stoplights and you will come to a "T" intersection at a stop sign with a flashing red light. <br>
        This is Cliff Dr.  Take a left. <br>
        COUNT 6 TELEPHONE POLES (a couple hundred yards) on the left side and there will be a blacktop driveway. Turn in there. <br>
        Go up the driveway and stay to the left. The road will turn to dirt and go through a second gate.  Park by the plastic porta-potty. <br>
        We have a red Subaru Brat with hang gliders on it.</p>
