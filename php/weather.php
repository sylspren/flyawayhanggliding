<h2>Weather for the training hill</h2>

<p><strong>Training hill conditions.</strong></p>
      <p>Our training hill works best when the winds are blowing from SSE (150 Degrees) to WSW (280 Deg).  These conditions happen over 300 days each year.  Large scale weather conditions that effect this are, winds aloft, pressure systems, clouds. Small scale conditions that effect this are; heating, cloud cover, the local mountains. Both large and small scale conditions interact with each other.  Normally from April through August we get a westerly flow that brings in the sea fog in making the training hill winds smooth, cool and consistent.  Fall, winter and spring also have great conditions unless we have Santa Ana winds or rain.  <br clear="all"></p>

<p><a href="http://www.findu.com/cgi-bin/wxpage.cgi?call=KF6HHY&amp;last=240" >Flores Flats</a> Is located in a canyon, behind and below the main launch at 2800'. The temperature is wrong for now. I am working on this. 
Never rely on this for a wind direction or speed. It just gives you an idea of what is going on in the canyon. It can show south when it is blowing East out front of launch. Strong winds are not good.</p>

<h2>Winter time mountain flying in Santa Barbara</h2 >
<p>All weather discussions here are over simplified.  Please contact one of our seasoned local pilots for guide service and more indepth weather knowledge.</p>

<p> www.SBSA.info</p>

<p>Winter is the best time of year for soaring the mountains in Santa Barbara.  Spring and fall are great times also.  Cold fronts cool the local mountain air below the ocean temperature which sets up a good lapse rate. Our launches in the Santa Ynez mountain range above Santa Barbara face south and get direct sun heating all day.  This is part of the only mountain range in the U.S. that runs east-west and is one of the reasons we have more flying days per year than many other sites in the U.S. Commonly as a cold front approaches, the wind will start blowing from the east one or two days ahead of the storm. As the storm is 1 day out, the upper level
clouds increase and temperatures start dropping. The atmospheric pressure also decreases. These east winds might increase in velocity.  When the cold front hits it becomes unstable.  This day might be a great flying day.  We often get cummulus clouds (cummies) forming over and in front of the mountain range, that scream, "Call in sick and go flying!".  If the front has enough moisture it can over-develop.  Visibility can be an issue.   After the front passes the winds switch to the northerly direction.  Depending on the front, winds might be too strong to fly. These days after the front are often our epic soaring days.  Then it starts to warm up and pressure increases again until we glide into to summer time flying.</p>
<H2>Summer time mountain flying in Santa Barbara</h2>
<p>In the summer, large scale high pressure systems set up inland, forcing most fronts up north.  The desert behind Santa Barbara heats up more than the ocean.  Since the normal upper air flow is northerly, this warm air gets pushed over the mountains down into Santa Barbara creating an inversion in the foothills.  .</p>
      <p>If the inversion is high enough, we can soar below it.  When the lapse rate is good we can get above the inversion.  If the inversion is low enough we can soar above it.  It raises during the day if the sun can shine through it.  It's easy to see a strong inversion, it's hazy in Santa Barbara but it is crystal clear up in the mountains, often around 3000 feet.  The winds can be going different directions from above and below it.  There can be multiple inversions and we can soar within each of these.  Quite commonly the wind above the inversion will be strong east.  Below the inversion it might be west to south-west.</p>
<p>During the day, with light winds, no high clouds and an inversion low enough to allow the upper southerly mountain faces to heat up we can launch and soar.  Rarely do we get above 4K in the summer.   Whereas in winter it's common to soar to 5000 or 6000 feet.   As the mountains cool off it blows down (catabatic, off-shore).  This window can be as short as 1/2 hour. This is how our Alternator launch site got it's name.
</p>

<p>Good indicators of conditions are atmospheric pressure, front passages, temperature, winds aloft, and
most important, talking to local pilots.</p>

      <p><a href="http://topaflyers.com/weather/soundings/vbg.png" id="Vandenburg_graph">Vandenberg balloon</a> is a balloon sounding recorder. It shows temperature/wind direction/ wind speed/ dew point and lapse rate from ground level through 18,000 feet. It is taken at 0000Z and 1200Z (7am). This gives you a rough idea of the lapse rate at altitude. It is taken north of Santa Barbara so it is more accurate when the winds are blowing from North West direction. All information below 4000 feet can be inaccurate because the local mountains change the local meteorology . Numbers in the center graphic show the lapse rate. Any reading 2 or better is good. Less or negative numbers make soaring harder.</p>

 <p><a  href="http://www.sbyc.org/wb.html">Santa Barbara Harbor</a> is a wind site on the beach and about one mile east of the training hill. It is more accurate than the  
 <a href="http://weather.noaa.gov/weather/current/KSBA.html">SBA</a> or <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/WXDailyHistory.asp?ID=KCASANTA122">Bel Air knolls</a> when the wind is blowing from the east.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.goes.noaa.gov/GSSLOOPS/wcwv.html"> GSS IR loop</a> shows the trend of the large scale air movement. Use this to see weather fronts. This shows moving moisture.</p>

<p><a href="http://newweb.wrh.noaa.gov/total_forecast/getprod.php?wfo=lox&amp;sid=lox&amp;pil=afd">Area discussion</a>This is a text forecast discussion of the weather analysts. It helps explain the guess work behind predicting the weather. </p>

<p><a href="http://weather.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/fmtbltn.pl?file=forecasts/marine/coastal/pz/pzz650.txt"><b>Marine Forcast</b></a> shows the predicted winds for the ocean.  This is not a good indication for actual conditions at the training hill but it does show conditions that can influence the training hill.  Often times, the marine forcast will be for high, east or offshore winds but the training hill will have excellent training conditions.</p>

<p><a href="http://topaflyers.com/weather/soundings/santabarbara.html"><b>Soaring Forecast</b></a> is an attempt to predict the winds and temperatures at altitudes based on any and all DATA from any site. The format is like the Vandenberg report.</p>

<p><a href="http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/queryFx?s=mtc&amp;d=now&amp;span=12hours"><b><font color="#0000ff">Montecito PK</font></b></a><font color="#000000">is located in the mountains at 1500 feet to the East of the eleminator launch. This hourly wind / temperature recorder helps give us a better idea of what the winds in the mountains are doing. For flying the mountains we prefer winds from 140 to 200 (SSE-SW) and less than 10 MPH.  We also can compare the temperature against <a href="#SBA">the airport</a> Which is located at sea level to give us a rough lapse rate.</font></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/WXDailyHistory.asp?ID=KCASANTA45">San Marcos Pass</a>Weather station located to the west of the alternator launch. The altitude is 2100 feet. This is another good indicator what is goin on at launch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.soaringpredictor.info/santabarb/Bates_Beach.htm">Bates </a>Is small a ocean ridge soaring site located ????? miles South east of Santa Barbara. It faces slightly South West and is soarable when the winds are strong out of the West to North West on the ocean. It is a windy cliff launch, over the ocean, with a beach landing. If conditions are good you can jump back to a long ridge behind, and continue down this ridge. Ocean tides can make the beach landing tricky.
