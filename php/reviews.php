  <h4>Share Your Experience with Fly Away Hang Gliding</h4>
  <p>I started flying hang gliders back in 1986. I had let the rating lapse and was only flying Paragliders. I decided to get my H2 rating back and had contacted
  Fly Away Hangliding. I was impressed with the claimed consistency of the training site. The Instructor Willy Dydo contacted me and we made plans to
  start in again and polish off the rust.

  It was a pleasure to work with Willy. His laid back manner was just what I needed. He guided me through my rough spots and did all he could to make the
  experience a meaningful one. Within a week I was able to get my H2 rating again. The site consistency was exactly what I needed. Willy was knowledgeable and
  presented concepts logically and reasonably. I'm happy to recommend Willy to anyone looking to get in the air! He will work for you. Thanks for a great experience Willy!!</p>

  <p>This letter is to express my gratefulness to you for introducing me to the incredible sport of hang gliding. It has now been more than 10 years that I have been enjoying the sport and am looking forward to many more decades of flight! What a wonderful opportunity you have to introduce people to the dream of flying. Your patience, knowledge, and dedication to hang gliding shows in how you work with your students. You make learning FUN! I remember my first flights on the training hill. It was so exciting. The "Brat" is classic... what a great way to maximize a students flight time without always having to "hike" your
  wing up to the top of the hill. Later... as I took my first mountain flightâ€¦ nothing can compare to the feeling of mountain flying with the birds, and the exhilarating rush of
  achievement after safely reaching the ground. I highly recommend Fly Away Hang Gliding to learn and ENJOY the sport of hang gliding. Please feel free to have potential students contact me with any questions or for personal reference. Thank You!</p>

  <p>Learning how to Hang Glide with Willy is amazing! He is patient, easy going and really knows how to work
  through any problem. Willy is willing to answer any question you have (no matter how many times he's heard them).
  His teaching style will give you the confidence you need to get over your fears. I started lessons with him in 2011,
  got my H2 in no time. The only thing I regret is not starting sooner!</p>

  <p>Having Willy as a hang-gliding instructor was a fantastic experience.
   He consistently went above and beyond his scope of responsibilities to truly make my time on the training hill as
   worthwhile as possible. I remember him literally running the glider up the training-hill dozens of times just so we could
   a couple of extra flights before the sun went down. It was a great pleasure to be taught by someone that cares so much for
   the sport.</p>
