        If you are traveling north on Hyw. 101 from Los Angeles, you will go left on Las Positas, towards the ocean. If you are traveling south from San Fransisco, go right on Las Positas.
        <br>
        Go about 1 mile, through several stoplights and you will come to a "T" intersection at a stop sign with a flashing red light. <br>
        This is Cliff Dr.  Take a left. <br>
        COUNT 6 TELEPHONE POLES (a couple hundred yards) on the left side and there will be a blacktop driveway. Turn in there. <br>
        Go up the driveway and stay to the left. The road will turn to dirt and go through a second gate.  Park by the plastic porta-potty. <br>
